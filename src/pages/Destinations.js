With confidence in our decades of experience, allow us take you on a cruise across the Mediterranean Sea. Be seduced by magic sunsets and savour the best recipes and typical local dishes. Find the right route for you: choose to embark on a journey of discovery in the Eastern Mediterranean and be overwhelmed by the charms of sailing, from Dubrovnik to Athens and onward to the Aegean Sea, and end with a few days in the splendid Greek islands, with a stopover in Santorini and Mykonos, with their crystalline waters, white sandy beaches and beautiful, deep blue sky. If you're looking for history and nightlife, opt instead for the Western Mediterranean and let us guide you to the places of interest, monuments and works of art in Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca. The fun continues to the lights of Ibiza, the most sensual of the Balearic Islands, and even further, passing through the pillars of Hercules and sailing to the shores of Madeira, the Canary Islands archipelago, and Lisbon.

The beauty of modern cities like Oslo and Stockholm is a joy to behold, as is the wealth of Tallinn and Copenhagen, with the beautiful little mermaid of Hans Christian Andersen's story winking at us from her rock in the middle of the sea.

This is a country where, against the backdrop of a harsh and difficult nature to tame, there is no lack of luxury, beauty, shopping and, above all, a crystal clear sea for fantastic diving. A thrill not to be missed during our cruise to Dubai is watching the sunset as the blackest of nights is created, full of stars, peace and immense beauty. ",
